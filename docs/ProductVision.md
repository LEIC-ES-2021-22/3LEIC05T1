## Product Vision

### Product Name

Uni Moodle Moodule - UMM

### Vision Stament

Our vision is to help FEUP's Moodle students frustrated with the need to use a different app. Uni Moodle Module (UMM) integrates Moodle into the Uni app, allowing users to visualize Moodle's Curricular Units' contents in their mobile device. Unlike the Moodle app the UMM doesn't require constant internet connection allowing for quick reference to previously visualized documents.
